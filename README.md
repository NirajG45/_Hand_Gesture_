## 📌 Overview

This project aims to:
- Capture video input from the user's webcam.
- Classify hand gestures using a pre-trained CNN model.
- Display the predicted gesture and confidence score on a web page in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Live webcam video capture in the browser.
- Frame-by-frame image classification using a CNN model.
- Display predictions instantly via Flask and JavaScript.
- Simple, fast, and responsive design.
